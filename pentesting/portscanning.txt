1. Passive information gathering:
I am investigating the domain NETFLIX
Netflix's IP address 156.154.144.121
I can see that Netflix is registered through GoDaddy, but cannot see when said domain will expire. I visited GoDaddy's website, but some of this information seems to be protected.
The command whois NETFLIX gives various emails, addresses, fax addresses, and phone numbers, as well as a list of "nservers" with IP addresses. 
Doing the command, "whois 156.154.144.121" (using it on one of the nserver IP addresses) forwards me to a domain privacy service.
The service name is NeuStar. I can see they are based in Sterling Virginia, and whois gives access to their phones and emails.

2. Host detection:
Local Hosts. 4 in total.
192.168.84.1
192.168.84.1
192.168.84.128
192.168.84.129
These IP addresses represent the various operating systens running on the computer. I assume 192.168.84.1 and 192.168.84.2 are responsible for the Mac OS, (I don't know why the mac needs two addresses though). 192.168.84.128 is the Metasploitable virtual machine, and 192.168.84.129 is our Kali virtual machine.
Local network, what steps did nmap take?:

3. Port scanning:
Which ports does Metasploitable have open?
PORT      STATE SERVICE
21/tcp    open  ftp
22/tcp    open  ssh
23/tcp    open  telnet
25/tcp    open  smtp
53/tcp    open  domain
80/tcp    open  http
111/tcp   open  rpcbind
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
512/tcp   open  exec
513/tcp   open  login
514/tcp   open  shell
1099/tcp  open  rmiregistry
1524/tcp  open  ingreslock
2049/tcp  open  nfs
2121/tcp  open  ccproxy-ftp
3306/tcp  open  mysql
5432/tcp  open  postgresql
5900/tcp  open  vnc
6000/tcp  open  X11
6667/tcp  open  irc
8009/tcp  open  ajp13
8180/tcp  open  unknown
55600/tcp open  unknown
Database servers: mysql. mysql has the capability to "ConnectWithDatabase" 
Value of the RSA SSH host key: Having a ssh host key exposed can result in vulnerability to person-in-the-middle attacks. The host key is used for authentication purposes and is generally unique, leading to the potential for exploit.
I had no clue what rpcbind was. Aparently, it's a server that converts RPC program numbers into universal addresses. Also, rpc stands for Remote Procedure Call.
