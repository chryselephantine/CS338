1. Passive information gathering
I am investigating the domain NETFLIX
Netflix's IP address 156.154.144.121
I can see that Netflix is registered through GoDaddy, but cannot see when said domain will expire. I even visited GoDaddy's website, but this information seems to be protected somewhat.
The command whois NETFLIX gives various emails, addresses, fax addresses, and phone numbers, as well as a list of "nservers" with IP addresses. 
Doing the command, whois 156.154.144.121 (one of the nserver IP addresses) forwards me to a domain privacy service.
The service name is NeuStar. I can see they are based in Sterling Virginia, and whois gives access to their phones and emails.
