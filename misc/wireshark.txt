===== DAYTIME =====

1. 1 172.16.4.128 132.163.96.6 TCP [SYN] Seq=0...
   2 132.163.96.6 172.16.4.128 TCP [SYN, ACK] Seq=0...
   3 172.16.4.128 132.163.96.6 TCP [ACK] Seq=1...

2. The client (the Kali virtual machine using netcat) uses port 44970. The client needs a port number so the server can send it info without interfering with other processes.

3. 4 132.163.96.6 172.16.4.128 DAYTIME DAYTIME Response

4. 59674 22-04-05 03:30:56 50 0 0 32.3 UTC(NIST) Year Month Day Hour Minute Second Timezone, The 59674 and 50 0 0 do not change upon giving multiple requests to the server, whereas the 32.3 seems somewhat random.

5. Synchronization, "Hey let's talk" in the context of the handshake.

6. Acknowledgement, "I hear you/message recieved"

7. Fin, the "finish up packet", "I'm done talking with you"

8. The client server initiated the closing of the TCP connection. This happened after the server gave it's DAYTIME protocol. The client (the source 172.16.4.128) said [FIN, ACK] "We are done talking because I got your message"

===== HTTP =====

1. 26 different TCP connections were opened in total.

2. Frame #7. This frame is the first HTTP request, and includes GET /index.html. 

3. Frame #11. This frame's info says GET /jeff_square_head.jpg

===== QUESTIONS =====

I had a lot of trouble with DAYTIME question 4. The additional info is not discussed in the daytime protocol and seems somewhat random at times. I'd like to know a bit more about what it is and how to figure that out.
