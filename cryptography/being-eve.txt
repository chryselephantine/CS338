========Diffie-Hellman========

The shared secret between alice and bob is 36.
This was somewhat tedious to compute. I used a brute-force method of trying every possible number (with the upper bound for X or Y being less than 59).
Used algebra on the equations ((11**X) % 59 = 57). For X < 59.
And ((11**Y) % 59 = 44). For Y < 59.
Once I have those equations satisfied, I plugged them into ((B**X) % 59) and ((A**Y) % 59) for the shared secret. 

This wouldn't work with large integers because I would have to iterate accross a huge number of integers if p was very large.
This is very doable by something like a for loop in python, yet I believe having to do this would slow Eve down long enough that she would likely miss her window of oprotunity.

========RSA========

How to decode this string of integers?

The attack uses a brute-force approach of sorts because we only have access to the public key. If we want to decode we need Bob's private key.
We can apply various private keys to the data until we find a result that seems to work. This would not work for very large integers because it is infeasable to do the calculations millions of times searching for a single solution.

The encoding process is independent to the encryption process, i.e. it does not depend on the RSA keys. The encoding can be broken if someone knows the code.
The encoding could be considered a small extra layer of protecton, but is much more vulnerable to analysis which could solve the code, or simply having the code be leaked.
